**Result**: ✅ System correctly processes and broadcasts alert

### Scenario 2: Alert Acknowledgment
**Input**: Field supervisor acknowledges active alert
**Expected Behavior**:
- Alert status changes to "Acknowledged"
- Escalation timer cancelled
- Acknowledgment timestamp recorded
- System logs user action

**Result**: ✅ Acknowledgment workflow functions correctly

### Scenario 3: Alert Resolution
**Input**: Incident resolved with detailed notes
**Expected Behavior**:
- Alert status changes to "Resolved"
- Resolution timestamp and notes recorded
- Alert removed from active list
- Complete audit trail maintained

**Result**: ✅ Resolution process works as designed

### Scenario 4: System Health Test
**Input**: Emergency system test command
**Expected Behavior**:
- Test alert created and immediately resolved
- All notification channels verified
- System status confirmation returned

**Result**: ✅ Health test validates system readiness
